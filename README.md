# Cancer segmentation techniques comparison
This project is for educational purposes. 

This project aims to compare the performance and efficacy of two cutting-edge object detection and segmentation algorithms, YOLOv8-Seg and YOLOv8-Det coupled with SAM (Segment Anything Model), in the context of tumor segmentation. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis to help researchers and medical professionals choose the most suitable model for their needs.
